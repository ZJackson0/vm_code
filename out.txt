20/07/2019, 12:44 - Zach: Tis rather good
20/07/2019, 12:44 - Anna: Yeah its apright
20/07/2019, 13:00 - Zach: I'm gonna get my help to buy ISA set up soon
20/07/2019, 13:00 - Anna: Defintely
20/07/2019, 13:00 - Anna: I make like 11 quid a month on mine
20/07/2019, 13:00 - Anna: Increasingg
20/07/2019, 13:01 - Zach: Only have till November 2019
20/07/2019, 13:01 - Zach: To set one up
20/07/2019, 13:01 - Anna: Yeah they are introducing life time isas instead
20/07/2019, 13:01 - Anna: Which you can either get out when you get a house or when you retire
20/07/2019, 13:02 - Zach: But you could have both in your life?
20/07/2019, 13:02 - Anna: Yeah but it's the only two times you can withdraw it
20/07/2019, 13:02 - Zach: Yeah
20/07/2019, 13:03 - Anna: If you are doing a help to buy put as much as you can for the first 1200
20/07/2019, 13:03 - Anna: Cos it takes agesss to build so if you can put as much as you can in
20/07/2019, 13:03 - Zach: But got until 2030 to cash it in though
20/07/2019, 13:04 - Zach: Tbh it's not gonna grow that much while I'm at uni
20/07/2019, 13:04 - Zach: We'll pick this up in person soon
20/07/2019, 13:04 - Anna: Well I opened mine in october 2017 and I've got 5545 pound in it
20/07/2019, 13:04 - Anna: So I've took 145 pound interest
20/07/2019, 13:04 - Zach: Thanks financial advisor Anna
20/07/2019, 13:05 - Zach: Flex
20/07/2019, 13:05 - Anna: Hahhaa my friends call me that
20/07/2019, 13:05 - Anna: 😂😂
20/07/2019, 13:05 - Anna: But if you are going to save even like 50 quid a month, it makes the most interest in one of those isas
20/07/2019, 13:06 - Anna: So it's worth opening even if its just that little
20/07/2019, 13:06 - Anna: And you can transfer it to lifetime isa if you changed your mind
20/07/2019, 13:06 - Anna: But lifetime isa is still new and isnt at many banks yet
20/07/2019, 13:06 - Zach: You don't get the government bonus with that do you?
20/07/2019, 13:07 - Anna: Yeah you doo
20/07/2019, 13:07 - Zach: Oh big
20/07/2019, 13:08 - Anna: You get 25 percent of what you have saved
20/07/2019, 13:08 - Anna: Startinf from 1600 so if you have 1600 you get 200 pound
20/07/2019, 13:09 - Anna: Max is 3000 but you need 12000 but lifetime you can get 4000 however I'm happy with the interest I'm making and maybe when lifetime is more established I will switch it oger
20/07/2019, 13:10 - Anna: So if I applied for a house now I would get 1300 pound extra.. but if you dont buy a house you can withdraw it anytime and just not get the bonus and take the interest
20/07/2019, 13:20 - Zach: Yeah that's big
20/07/2019, 13:20 - Zach: I'm going to get it sorted
20/07/2019, 13:21 - Anna: Good smart move
20/07/2019, 13:21 - Zach: Am v smart so
